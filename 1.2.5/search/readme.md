BNP can optionally refresh catalogs for a city by sub-category, e.g. for Grocery (ONDC:RET10), catalog can be refreshed separately for each [sub-category](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1APAvavF_BNbTA89benAlGtv0GuFvpn2b6XXi4lSdTTw/edit?gid=0#gid=0):
- e.g. for "Bakery, Cakes & Dairy", Context.domain="ONDC:RET10", category.id = "Bakery, Cakes & Dairy";
- distributed search i.e. by category will also allow differential buyer finder fee for different sub-categories in a domain;
- however, this will not be possible for categories, such as F&B, where no such sub-categories are defined;
